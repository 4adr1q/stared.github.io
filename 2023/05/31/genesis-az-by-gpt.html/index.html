It felt much in the line of constrained poetry, alike <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lem/WonderfulPoems.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Trurl's Electronic Bard</a> written by Stanisław Lem and beautifully (ergo not faithfully) translated into English by Michael Kandel.</p>
<p>I got curious - which other letters work for this task? I went with 's'. Purely manually, with no help of AI or a voice from heaven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supreme Spirit shaped: spaces, stone.<br>
Stone shapeless, stark, shadowed. Surface suspended Supreme Spirit.<br>
Supreme Spirit said: shine. Saw shine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't bother to finish - by induction, it will work for any number of lines.
Would it be possible to make it easy with AI?</p>
<p>At that time GPT-3 was the best model. It didn't work at all. Neither did GPT3.5, the basis of the first ChatGPT. At least not out of the box. We can fine-tune these models, i.e. train them on additional, suitable data. See <a href="https://gwern.net/gpt-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GPT-2 Poetry</a> and <a href="https://gwern.net/gpt-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GPT-4 Creative Fiction</a> by Gwern.</p>
<p>GPT-4 turned out to be the game-changer - it works out of the box, in a zero-shot way. That is, the only thing you need is to give an instruction. No need to provide any examples, less so - perform fine-tuning. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/piotr.migdal.9/posts/pfbid0utetW16tFfjgi9AD4uYR3VpQRCPgRVSpLdcfMCFWBJDjUhPaEE6SzoxGozGPFepRl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">My very first approach</a> turned out to be decently successful:</p>

<p>1 At arrival, Almighty assembled above and abyss.<br>
2 Abyss absent actuality, abandoned, all around abysmal, Almighty's aura above aqua.<br>
3 Almighty articulated, "Actualize aurora," and aurora appeared.<br>
4 Almighty acknowledged aurora's appeal, and aurora away abyss.<br>
5 Almighty announced aurora "awake," and abyss "asleep." And afternoon, and aurora arrived—alpha age.<br>
6 Almighty articulated, "Assemble arch amid aqua, apart aqua and aqua."<br>
7 Accordingly, Almighty assembled arch, apart aqua adown arch and aqua atop. And accomplished.<br>
8 Almighty announced arch "atmosphere." And afternoon, and aurora arrived—another age.<br>
9 Almighty articulated, "Aggregate aqua adown atmosphere at area, also arid area arise." And accomplished.<br>
10 Almighty announced arid area "acreage," and aggregated aqua "aquatic." And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>
11 Afterward Almighty articulated, "Acreage advance abundant: agricultural articles and arbores around acreage, abundant with almonds, assorted." And accomplished.<br>
12 Acreage advanced abundant: agricultural articles abundant with almonds assorted and arbores abundant with almonds assorted. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>
13 And afternoon, and aurora arrived—apex age.<br>
14 Almighty articulated, "Actualize astral above atmosphere, apart awake and asleep, also accenting appointed anniversaries, and ages and annuals,<br>
15 also as astral above atmosphere, allowing illumination around acreage." And accomplished.<br>
16 Almighty assembled ample astral—the ampler astral authorizing awake, and another astral authorizing asleep. Additionally, astronomical entities.<br>
17 Almighty allocated astral above atmosphere, allowing illumination around acreage,<br>
18 authorizing awake and asleep, and apart aurora and abyss. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>
19 And afternoon, and aurora arrived—quartet age.<br>
20 Almighty articulated, "Aqua abound animated entities, and avians ascend across atmosphere."<br>
21 Accordingly, Almighty actualized ample aquatic animals and animate aqua, agitated and active, assorted, and airborne avians assorted. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>
22 Almighty applauded and articulated, "Amplify and augment; add aqua animals and amplify avians around acreage."<br>
23 And afternoon, and aurora arrived—quintet age.<br>
24 Almighty articulated, "Actualize acreage animals assorted: animal agriculture, ambulatory animals, and animalistic, all assorted." And accomplished.<br>
25 Almighty actualized animalistic animals assorted, animal agriculture assorted, and ambulatory animals assorted. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>
26 Afterwards Almighty articulated, "Assemble anthropoids, alike and analogous us; authorize authority above aquatic and avians, above animal agriculture and animalistic animals, and above ambulatory animals around acreage."<br>
27 And Almighty actualized anthropoids, alike Almighty, analogous Almighty actualized; androgynous and gynandrous actualized.<br>
28 Almighty applauded and articulated, "Amplify and augment; annex acreage and administer. Administer aquatic and avians and above animate ambulatory animals."<br>
29 Almighty articulated, "Allocate agrarian almonds around all acreage and arbores abundant with almonds. Allocated as aliment.<br>
30 And animalistic animals and avians and ambulatory animals—all animated with animation—I allocate agrarian articles as aliment." And accomplished.<br>
31 Almighty admired all assembled, and absolutely amazing. And afternoon, and aurora arrived—adjacent age.</p>

<p>Sure, you can complain that a few words start with a different letter - the same way that <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7209" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GPT-4 gets only a B on a quantum computing exam</a>.</p>
<p>GPT-3.5 is stubborn - once it gets an answer (even if wildly incorrect) it is hard to move forward. GPT-4 is much better at collaborating - it will try to apply your suggestions. If you point to an error, it will admit it and try to make suitable changes. Very often it takes a few iterations to get a suitable result.</p>
