# Minimum Viable Resume

I am looking for ambitious challenges combining advanced data science with the end-user experience. As a technical visionary, I will drive your product from 0 to 1!

While most of my experience is in machine learning, deep learning, data viz and quantum computing - these tools, as useful as they help our clients. I would happily consider industries such as medtech, biotech, and user-centric AI. Ideal roles include Technical Product Manager, CTO, Head of AI, and Data Science Tech Lead.

If there is a match, contact me at `pmigdal@gmail.com`. See more on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrmigdal/).
