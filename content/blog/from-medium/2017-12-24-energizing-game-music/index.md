When I need an energy boost to start working, I open [http://www.infinitelooper.com](http://www.infinitelooper.com/) to listen to sounds I know well and which give me a kick. One of my go-to choices is epic music from computer games — both as some of these soundtracks are masterpieces, and as they bring back memories of a fight for life & death.

#### Ori and the Blind Forest

A visually beautiful and emotionally captivating platformer, matching the difficulty of old-school games (when it wasn’t enough to “press > to progress”). Escape sequences can be challenging even for a seasoned player.

As a note: all of its music is is beautiful. Just listen to the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cklw-Yu3moE).

#### Total Annihilation

> What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds.

A classic RTS with humans and machines waging their final war. With planets turning from jungle forests to wastelands of ash and wreckages. And, during the process of destruction, there is no better tune than:

#### StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void

StarCraft 2 is an RTS requiring Korean-level mastery of mouse clicks, as slowing for a moment means having to “gg”.

> Defeat your masters, or fall beneath them. — The edicts of Rak’Shir

During Alarak’s (pretty much a Protoss Sith) duel with (soon-to-be former) Highlord, our army marches to:

#### Earth 2140

For slightly older music, here’s one from a Polish RTS in a post-apocalyptic war with terminator-style soldiers. Though, this one works much better with a lot of explosions going on:
