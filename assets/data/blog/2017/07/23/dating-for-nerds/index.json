And most likely, with a little bit of work on yourself, you will get a happy dating, sex and love life!\nI want to help you with this series of articles on dating for (male, hetero) nerds (or: geeks, programmers, introverted intellectuals).</p>\n<p>Before we go to the more juicy parts, let’s diagnose the problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intro\"><a href=\"#intro\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Intro</h2>\n<h3 id=\"personal-disclaimer\"><a href=\"#personal-disclaimer\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Personal disclaimer</h3>\n<p>I am not sure if I want to publish pieces of dating advice on my semi-professional blog. It is a soft, opinionated and personal matter, inadvertently revealing my secrets and vulnerabilities. Though, if it is true that <em>\"data science is the sexiest job of the 21st century\"</em>, maybe machine learning and dating are not that far apart. ;)</p>\n<p>Also, to be clear: I don’t claim to be <em>\"good at dating\"</em>[^suckless], whatever that means. But I see the profound change from something being frustrating to a field where I feel well. And I would like to share some lessons I’ve learned in the process, often the hard way. While my problems with dating (or rather: not dating) gave me a lot of pain, they also prompted me to put a lot of effort into developing social skills in general.</p>\n<p>Sure, there is no shortage of Internet dating advice. Yet, there weren’t many things I found illuminating (I link to ones that were). Nerds have special needs, special skills and things which may work differently (honesty, emotions, touch, spontaneity, expectations of partners) - general advice rarely cuts it.\nSome great minds consider this problem notoriously hard:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How to help all the young male nerds I meet who suffer from [the dating] problem, in a way that passes feminist muster, and that triggers the world’s sympathy rather than outrage[?]</p>\n<p>I believe that, just as there are shy, nerdy men, there are also shy, nerdy women, who likewise suffer from feeling unwanted, sexually invisible, or ashamed to express their desires.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">What I believe by Scott Aaronson</a>, a wider context in <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Untitled by Scott Alexander </a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But well, <em>fortune favours the bold</em>. :)\nI spiked it with numerous references, so even if you fine with dating, you may find a few interesting links (I am <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:pmigdal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">an unabashed link hoarder</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"whos-that-for\"><a href=\"#whos-that-for\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Who's that for?</h3>\n<p>This text is addressed to <strong>heterosexual male nerds</strong>. Ideally, I would send it to my younger self[^alchemist] (say, 15-25yo - the sooner the better), so as to be spared a lot of unnecessary emotional pain, feelings of loneliness, rejection and isolation. But, well, I actually want to help people, so it is wiser to think about a wider (not-empty!) audience.</p>\n<p>A lot of this content might be useful for other groups (gender, sexual orientation, level of nerdiness). If you are not in the <em>\"main target\"</em>, yet find it useful - I am really interested in your feedback! Conversely, each person is different, so what was important for me may be irrelevant (or even harmful) for you[^consult].</p>\n<p>Dating is not easy for anyone. Most people struggle with it at some point, not only nerds. And it’s fine to be nervous. At the same time, the bar is not so high - all you need is to get a bit of understanding of yourself, your body, other people and dating dynamics. By putting in some conscious effort you will get ahead of most men!</p>\n<p>A large portion of this information is on approaching people in general, or advancing any relationship - surprisingly many things I learnt from dating are crucial for my networking skills (which, as a semi-freelancer, I use a lot). Job interviews have similar dynamics - just instead of getting laid you want to land a job (you need to <em>interest them in you</em> rather than express your neediness).</p>\n<p>The topic <strong>dating</strong> may sound ambiguous - is it about looking for casual sex or the search for the love of your life? What I’ve found the most problematic is the transition from platonic contact to a romantic or sexual relationship, which works the same way regardless of relationship type or goal. Typically the most defining moment is the first committed French kiss. Most of advice here will be focused how to get to this moment.</p>\n<p>Also, if you are on the recipient side of a nerd’s (however clumsy) courtship, I hope that you will learn a bit about his POV and be able to help him (whether it means taking command or turning him down in a clear but graceful way). And pointing them to this blog post (ideally: not in a passive-aggressive way) would be great! :)</p>\n<h3 id=\"it-is-not-about\"><a href=\"#it-is-not-about\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>It is not about</h3>\n<p>Before I proceed to it, let me lower your expectation. So, this text is not about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appealing to any girl</strong>. If picking up as many girls as possible is your goal, there are better sources. Here I will focus on approaching girls you are genuinely interested in.</li>\n<li><strong>A motivational talk</strong>. I won’t invent anything better than this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TPn1-SJqVM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mongoose fending off lions</a>; still, scaring off every interested female is not the thing you want to do.</li>\n<li><strong>A magical trick</strong> (like <a href=\"http://www.bash.org/?111338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">s/wand/wang/</a>). It might be that there will be a single piece of advice that will remove a crucial blockade. But most growth is a step-by-step process, taking time and during which you need to get out of your comfort zone.</li>\n<li><strong>A zero-sum game mindset</strong>. Unfortunately, a lot of mainstream dating advice uses a competition or conflict metaphor, where one side (whether a man or a woman) advances at the cost of the other. Here I want to focus on things that are mutually beneficial.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How to maintain a relationship</strong>. While it is a crucial topic, it is a very different activity than getting into one. However, these links may be helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/23/fashion/weddings/marriage-questions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">13 Questions to Ask Before Getting Married</a> by Eleanor Stanford</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/i-polled-1500-people-about-their-best-relationship-advice-and-the-same-themes-came-up-over-and-over-2016-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I polled 1,500 people about their best relationship advice — and everyone said the same thing</a> by Mark Manson</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"nerds\"><a href=\"#nerds\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Nerds</h2>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-a-nerd\"><a href=\"#who-is-a-nerd\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Who is a nerd?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A geek is a nerd with a non-zero chance of having sex - Staszek Krawczyk</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I use the word <strong>nerd</strong> a lot, it’s not about self-identification (here is a very stereotypical case in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">White &#x26; Nerdy by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic</a>).

Just reading this blog post beyond the 140 character baseline is a good indicator that you may like its content. All bookworms, and blogworms, are welcome!</p>\n<p>In short, nerds are typically defined as having a combination of intelligence, obsession and social awkwardness (as covered in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/nerd-venn-diagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this classic Venn diagram</a>).\nIf you really want to dive into this topic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110829164446/http://www.geekstudies.org/2007/06/geeks-vs-nerds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Geeks vs Nerds - Geek Studies</a> by Jason Tocci (his <a href=\"http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/953/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PhD thesis on this topic</a>) and links therein</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/on-geek-versus-nerd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">On “Geek” Versus “Nerd”</a> by Burr Settles, with a data-driven approach (using <a href=\"http://p.migdal.pl/2017/01/06/king-man-woman-queen-why.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">word co-occurrences I posted about</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://crastina.se/autistic-traits-science-and-the-nerd-stereotype/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Autistic traits, science and the nerd stereotype</a> by me</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"social-and-sex-life-of-nerds\"><a href=\"#social-and-sex-life-of-nerds\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Social and sex life of nerds</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alan Turing: They only beat me up because I'm smarter than they are.<br>\nChristopher Morcom: No, they beat you up because you're different.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Imitation Game 2014 film</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Social life may not be fun, especially during childhood and adolescence - with severity ranging from being an outsider to being totally excluded or actively bullied. Nerds may get it harder with interpersonal skills and their social rank, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Why Nerds are Unpopular</a> by Paul Graham (2003)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dating is a social activity - so there should be no surprise that such problems may make it hard to date. On top of being different, there are nerd-specific issues, covered in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/129887/why_being_smart_won&#x27;t_get_you_laid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Why Being Smart Won't Get You Laid</a> by Alex Benzer (2008)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short - being very picky and having a main focus other than mating makes dating hard. Winning a math competition is unlikely to make you much more sexually appealing. At the same time, overthinking and being a disembodied brain on a stick makes dating much harder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120318003901/http://wulffmorgenthaler.com/strip/2010/04/02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 666 230' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7d485140934b3e2eaf445eccb932f955'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7d485140934b3e2eaf445eccb932f955)' width='666' height='230' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2by25b3YdKPqItduGnmADMU45T9x9NZnlcZ8RlG0Ojp1jYrSWLdWOpYEjIYg5YoOMBieO7x41N3GSJqF5FaNnSF%2b5QQSPwnyPbSevdVbhb7JdvspIjxpJKpiYdzHIBX6ntKjJxyD5OvV7cLIhsy1JnS7LXYTvF3d7AD9fJ%2brH9vOt934Six6RKPSTgflHt9tRJZ3A9SN6noE4VnJGf8AXnWC%2bI/U7bFvm0QG08UM1bJ7U7hG3eoD4/UfIxwAAfrqH8Tuqa1W3SihnE9aOu7SvUCyFWPb2457c/bzg50VBjLE7wofm0TuClswqSMD2yff7a6izWMrRCaH1VIDJ3DuBPjI8jOlV1P1Qlr4bUxJZmi3OaNR6KBoywYsndn3C9pPnnAz50ua%2b5Mst2dTO8t6GPtSRw2Cn5mY4/ETjj6Z1NNLlWjqp6HL8Q5Y61OvbaFZJa%2bHjJJBUk4zkc%2b4P8aTnVFI9TyQLZc1zK6lo4CFSSQjHexIJzj%2bPtzo0aLqG1kVDwVx2bmtFtmz7alG1FPLcgSWrLLFhUaJjkoBnOMjjPj%2bddpo9n2%2bqifLzpFMrAtCFVyMZxkYOM/fRo01IEmb8Nutbglndo57FmvBGUkHaCqeoAMAYBIY55/vVlumz7Vvtzb6MslpLDySMsscccYChcsCBxycc4zxo0a0GVO511v/AAq6egllljEluOEyIAWA9RweDx4HjWH2jpuO1Hsbm7ZT5jb5bb9oX8LKWGFyPHHvo0avVo75s//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"666\" alt=\"Einstein sex genius - WulffmorgentHaller webcomic strip \" data-srcset=\"/migdal-blog-gridsome/assets/static/einstein_strip_genius_wulffmorgenthaler.bcbd287.b5dfa04ac9d9340e1fb6a4bcafb43da8.jpg 666w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\" data-src=\"/migdal-blog-gridsome/assets/static/einstein_strip_genius_wulffmorgenthaler.bcbd287.b5dfa04ac9d9340e1fb6a4bcafb43da8.jpg\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/migdal-blog-gridsome/assets/static/einstein_strip_genius_wulffmorgenthaler.bcbd287.b5dfa04ac9d9340e1fb6a4bcafb43da8.jpg\" width=\"666\" alt=\"Einstein sex genius - WulffmorgentHaller webcomic strip \"></noscript></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikaelwulff/status/881894399185211394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">(C) by WulffmorgentHaler (2010), used with permission</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong - witty humour and an extensive vocabulary may help a lot, as well as some possible side-effects (such as good social standing or popularity).

So, it may be not because of being smart, but - different.\nIt mentions some really scary statistics like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the age of 19, 80% of US males and 75% of women have lost their virginity, and 87% of college students have had sex. But this number appears to be much lower at elite (i.e. more intelligent) colleges.

However, it does not absolve you of responsibility for checking if what you do is fine!

But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole. - <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Social_Network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Social Network 2010 film</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The whole <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfe2fe4aovY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">opening scene from The Social Network movie</a> may make one cringe - it is a beautiful depiction of a smart, obsessed and arrogant nerd. It’s not only a misunderstanding - it’s constant ignoring and judging his date.</p>\n<p>Even if you are (or were) underprivileged socially it does not automatically make you a good person. Being bullied does not guarantee you won’t turn into a bully, vide this cynical twist of <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-05-23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Ugly Duckling</a> comic strip by <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SMBC</a>. What’s worse is when it goes beyond being unpleasant to being violent:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The men who sexually trespass against me are nearly always men who are unhappy or at a difficult point in their life. They are nearly always men who experience social isolation more generally. They are also nearly always men not actively dating any other women.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@emmalindsay/how-extreme-need-leads-to-male-entitlement-e758241305c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How Extreme Need Leads to Male Entitlement</a> by Emma Lindsay</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She, as a clearly nerdy woman, talks about her violators with a great deal of compassion, understanding and insight. To make it clear - no amount of suffering you received gives you a pass to harm innocent people. Through the remainder of this blog post series I make a strong assumption that you are committed to treating others with care, and not taking an unfair advantage, regardless of the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Sure, nerds may come as insensitive, uncaring and rude, even if their intentions are good, see <a href=\"http://maylin22.blogspot.com/2013/12/intp-asshole.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">INTP = asshole?</a>.\nOften it is an unfair judgement - based on comparison with their <em>\"obvious\"</em> cultural norms. However, <strong>I am a nerd</strong> is not a get out of a jail card, and if anything - <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">will cause more ostracism than compassion</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, while in your workplace people may tolerate your ways, and turn a blind eye to your <em>\"difficult character\"</em> if you are an expert, the same thing won’t work in relationships.

Some of them may be fellow nerds, some not, but still considering intellect, introversion and deep interests sexy (a key word: <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sapiosexual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">sapiosexual</a>). For some others your nerdism might be not relevant at all (just one of many aspects of your personality). Most importantly - if you are into some girl for her interests and character, there is a fair chance that she may find you as fascinating.</p>\n<p>While still I have a soft spot for nerdesses, I no longer restrict to this circle. Dating non-nerds is not like dating outside of your religion… or species. OK, maybe it is a bit, but still - it may be worth it. While some differences may be tricky, some other may be very much complementary (vide this <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/309/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nerd shopping xkcd strip</a>).</p>\n<p>One friend of mine wanted to write <em>\"Why do neurotypical girls fancy nerdy boys?\"</em>, on her romantic interests. When I asked her why, she said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I find genuine, intense interests and a lot of curiosity very attractive. - MS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While being different may have resulted in bullying in primary school, now it may be an advantage - you stand out! Also, particular interests may make it easier to find a very non-random girl - by meeting her through a network of like-minded friends, or at a specialistic event.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best dating website? <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Meetup.com</a>! - Sarah Martin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to attractiveness, <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/themathematicsofbeauty.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Mathematics Of Beauty - How you can use your flaws to your advantage</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gwern/comments/aapn1l/okcupid_blog_archives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">former OkCupid blog</a> shows that it is better to be very attractive to some (and non-attractive to others) rather than just ‘OK’ to everyone.
