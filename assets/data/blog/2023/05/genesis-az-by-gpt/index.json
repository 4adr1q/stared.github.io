It felt much in the line of constrained poetry, alike <a href=\"http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lem/WonderfulPoems.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Trurl's Electronic Bard</a> written by Stanisław Lem and beautifully (ergo not faithfully) translated into English by Michael Kandel.</p>\n<p>I got curious - which other letters work for this task? I went with 's'. Purely manually, with no help of AI or a voice from heaven.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Supreme Spirit shaped: spaces, stone.<br>\nStone shapeless, stark, shadowed. Surface suspended Supreme Spirit.<br>\nSupreme Spirit said: shine. Saw shine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn't bother to finish - by induction, it will work for any number of lines.\nWould it be possible to make it easy with AI?</p>\n<p>At that time GPT-3 was the best model. It didn't work at all. Neither did GPT3.5, the basis of the first ChatGPT. At least not out of the box. We can fine-tune these models, i.e. train them on additional, suitable data. See <a href=\"https://gwern.net/gpt-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GPT-2 Poetry</a> and <a href=\"https://gwern.net/gpt-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GPT-4 Creative Fiction</a> by Gwern.</p>\n<p>GPT-4 turned out to be the game-changer - it works out of the box, in a zero-shot way. That is, the only thing you need is to give an instruction. No need to provide any examples, less so - perform fine-tuning. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/piotr.migdal.9/posts/pfbid0utetW16tFfjgi9AD4uYR3VpQRCPgRVSpLdcfMCFWBJDjUhPaEE6SzoxGozGPFepRl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">My very first approach</a> turned out to be decently successful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 At arrival, Almighty assembled above and abyss.<br>\n2 Abyss absent actuality, abandoned, all around abysmal, Almighty's aura above aqua.<br>\n3 Almighty articulated, \"Actualize aurora,\" and aurora appeared.<br>\n4 Almighty acknowledged aurora's appeal, and aurora away abyss.<br>\n5 Almighty announced aurora \"awake,\" and abyss \"asleep.\" And afternoon, and aurora arrived—alpha age.<br>\n6 Almighty articulated, \"Assemble arch amid aqua, apart aqua and aqua.\"<br>\n7 Accordingly, Almighty assembled arch, apart aqua adown arch and aqua atop. And accomplished.<br>\n8 Almighty announced arch \"atmosphere.\" And afternoon, and aurora arrived—another age.<br>\n9 Almighty articulated, \"Aggregate aqua adown atmosphere at area, also arid area arise.\" And accomplished.<br>\n10 Almighty announced arid area \"acreage,\" and aggregated aqua \"aquatic.\" And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>\n11 Afterward Almighty articulated, \"Acreage advance abundant: agricultural articles and arbores around acreage, abundant with almonds, assorted.\" And accomplished.<br>\n12 Acreage advanced abundant: agricultural articles abundant with almonds assorted and arbores abundant with almonds assorted. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>\n13 And afternoon, and aurora arrived—apex age.<br>\n14 Almighty articulated, \"Actualize astral above atmosphere, apart awake and asleep, also accenting appointed anniversaries, and ages and annuals,<br>\n15 also as astral above atmosphere, allowing illumination around acreage.\" And accomplished.<br>\n16 Almighty assembled ample astral—the ampler astral authorizing awake, and another astral authorizing asleep. Additionally, astronomical entities.<br>\n17 Almighty allocated astral above atmosphere, allowing illumination around acreage,<br>\n18 authorizing awake and asleep, and apart aurora and abyss. And Almighty agreed acceptable.<br>\n19 And afternoon, and aurora arrived—quartet age.<br>\n20 Almighty articulated, \"Aqua abound animated entities, and avians ascend across atmosphere.\"<br>\n21 Accordingly, Almighty actualized ample aquatic animals and animate aqua, agitated and active, assorted, and airborne avians assorted.

And afternoon, and aurora arrived—adjacent age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, you can complain that a few words start with a different letter - the same way that <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7209\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GPT-4 gets only a B on a quantum computing exam</a>.</p>\n<p>GPT-3.5 is stubborn - once it gets an answer (even if wildly incorrect) it is hard to move forward. GPT-4 is much better at collaborating - it will try to apply your suggestions. If you point to an error, it will admit it and try to make suitable changes. Very often it takes a few iterations to get a suitable result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each token is a unit of thinking</li>\n<li>It thinks forward</li>\n</ul>\n","date":"31 May 2023","timeToRead":3,"image":null,"author":"","medium_url":"","mentions":[]}},"context":{}}
