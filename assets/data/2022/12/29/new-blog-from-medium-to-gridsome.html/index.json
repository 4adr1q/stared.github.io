To see how it works, pick any combination of date and popularity.</li>\n<li>There used to be two lists of posts, one for posts I host, and the other for published elsewhere. It was confusing - so I created a single list. Where it is published is an \"implementation detail\".</li>\n<li>Copied all posts from Medium here. This deserves a separate thread - which I provide below.</li>\n<li>Switched from Google Analytics to <a href=\"https://plausible.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Plausible</a>, which is simpler and more respectful of privacy.</li>\n<li>Slightly different naming. This post is <code>/blog/2022/12/new-blog-from-medium-to-gridsome</code> rather than <code>/2022/12/29/new-blog-from-medium-to-gridsome.html</code>. Yet, I made sure that all old links work.</li>\n<li>A lot of technical things that make it more enjoyable for me to develop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"picking-gridsome\"><a href=\"#picking-gridsome\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Picking Gridsome</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gridsome</a> is a Vue-based static site generator. It was a no-brainer to go for static sites - much easier to write and deploy, and I don't need any server. Also, for evergreen content, it is likely to stay much longer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a>, which is React-based, is way more popular and actively developed. I am all for the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React</a> philosophy, including that it uses JavaScript for templating rather than some made-up syntax. Yet, in Gatsby the simplest things (such as blog post routing) there are many ways to go. It felt like giving me tools rather than solutions. In a contrast, in Gridsome things worked out of the box.</p>\n<p>So, I picked Gridsome. I already use Vue (especially in <a href=\"https://lab.quantumflytrap.com/lab?mode=waves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Virtual Lab by Quantum Flytrap</a>). And it just works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-from-jekyll\"><a href=\"#moving-from-jekyll\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Moving from Jekyll</h2>\n<p>This one was easy. Just a few path changes, both for content and internal links. A few regular expressions did the job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-from-medium\"><a href=\"#moving-from-medium\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Moving from Medium</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Medium</a> is a blog posting platform. Anyone can create an account and start writing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why\"><a href=\"#why\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why</h3>\n<p>For some time a lot of tech community started writing there, myself included.\nNow it has less favorable opinions - to the point that <a href=\"https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&#x26;page=0&#x26;prefix=true&#x26;query=medium&#x26;sort=byPopularity&#x26;type=story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the Hackers News crowd seems to hate Medium</a>.\nI share some (but not all) of the concerns.\nHowever:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I write for the readers. And the readers' experience matters.</li>\n<li>I want to have all of my writings in one place, rather than distributed among various platforms.</li>\n<li>I like to create the whole website according to my needs (and quirks).</li>\n<li>And, well, I can.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, to be clear - I don't boycott anything. My Medium blog posts stay there, I even link them here.\nBut all of the changes</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you want to write your first post, I recommend Medium by all means!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how\"><a href=\"#how\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How</h3>\n<p>Moving from Medium needed a few steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Downloading blog posts locally, see <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004745787-Export-your-account-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">export your account data</a>.</li>\n<li>Turning them into Markdown with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/medium-2-md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">medium-2-md</a>.</li>\n<li>Using a custom Python script to put images nicely in folders and to process some parts of the front matter. The script in the as-it-is form is <a href=\"https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io/blob/main/content/blog/from-medium/clean_medium-2-md-for-gridsome.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Converting images to jpg (many png were large, and I wanted to keep a typical image file around 100kB). Used <a href=\"https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mogrify</a>, <code>mogrify -format jpg *.png</code>. Also, gifs are not supported - so turned them into jpgs or pngs.</li>\n<li>Manual changes to set thumbnails, create frontmatter (e.g. tags), add image captions (they were lost by <code>medium-2-md</code>), some other changes (e.g. for an unknown reason Gridsome does not display two or more subsequent images).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I had to do it for the second time, I guess I would write my own library for turning Medium posts into Markdown suitable for Gridsome (or any other static blog).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\"><a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What's next?</h2>\n<p>The source is here <a href=\"https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io</a>.</p>\n","date":"29 December 2022","timeToRead":3,"image":null,"author":"","medium_url":"","mentions":[]}},"context":{"path":"/blog/2022/12/new-blog-from-medium-to-gridsome/"}}
